# IBM Watson Studio Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores user interactions with articles on IBM Watson Studio to build a recommendation engine. The goal is to enhance user engagement by suggesting relevant articles based on their past interactions. 

Using various recommendation techniques, including rank-based methods, collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization, we analyze user behavior and provide personalized content recommendations.

## 🔍 Features & Methodology
The project implements multiple recommendation techniques:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understanding user interactions and article engagement.
2. **Rank-Based Recommendations** - Recommending top articles based on popularity.
3. **User-User Collaborative Filtering** - Finding similar users to recommend articles based on shared interests.
4. **Matrix Factorization** - Implementing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user preferences.
